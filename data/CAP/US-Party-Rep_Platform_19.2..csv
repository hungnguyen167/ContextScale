1980,5600,16,1612,16,1612,The armed forces of the U.S. are today critically dependent upon our nation's Reserve components for both combat arms and combat support.,22
1980,5601,16,1612,16,1612,"The Army Reserve and National Guard provide one-third of the Army's combat divisions, 80 percent of its independent combat brigades, one-half of its artillery battalions, and one-third of its special forces groups.",32
1980,5602,16,1612,16,1612,The Navy Reserve provides 90 percent of the Navy's ocean mine sweeping and two-thirds of its mobile construction battalions.,19
1980,5603,16,1612,16,1612,"The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard provide all of our strategic interceptors, 60 percent of our tactical airlift, and one-third of our tactical fighters.",26
1980,5604,16,1612,16,1612,Reserve and National Guard units may be mobilized for even the smallest of conflicts and many such units today are expected to deploy immediately with the active duty units they support.,31
1980,5605,16,1612,16,1612,"Today, however, the reserves are ill-equipped, underpaid, and undermanned by several hundred thousand personnel.",14
1980,5606,16,1612,16,1612,"Proper [p.34] equipment, realistic, challenging training, and greater full-time support must be made available.",14
1980,5607,16,1612,16,1612,We must ensure that all Americans take note of the proud and vital role played by the Reserve and National Guard components of the Armed Forces of the United States.,30
1980,5608,16,1604,16,1604,History records that readiness for war is the surest means of preventing it.,13
1980,5609,16,1604,16,1604,Lack of preparedness is the most dangerously provocative course we can take.,12
1980,5610,16,1604,16,1604,"Yet funding requests for sufficient fuel, spare parts, ammunition, and supplies for U.S. war reserves have been cut each year for the past four years from the minimum quantities the armed services have stated they need.",36
1980,5611,16,1604,16,1604,"This has left the U.S. Armed Forces at their lowest state of preparedness since 1950, seriously compromising their ability to sustain a military conflict.",24
1980,5612,16,1604,16,1604,"Crippling shortages of spare parts, fuel, and ammunition compromise the ability of the armed forces to sustain a major military conflict.",21
1980,5613,16,1604,16,1604,Some critical types of ammunition could not support combat operations for more than a week although we are committed to holding a 90-day inventory of major ammunition types.,28
1980,5614,16,1604,16,1604,"In addition, critical facilities such as airfields, ammunition depots, maintenance installations, and living quarters for our troops are in serious disrepair.",21
1980,5615,16,1604,16,1604,The backlog of deferred maintenance and the underfunded purchase of vital combat consumables is so vast that years of effort will be required to rebuild U.S. forces to the required level of readiness.,33
1980,5616,16,1604,16,1604,The problem of maintaining the day-to-day combat readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces is compounded by the reduced ability of American industry to respond to wartime contingencies.,27
1980,5617,16,1604,16,1604,Reduced acquisition of equipment for the modernization of the armed forces and the Carter Administration's failure to maintain combat readiness have eroded the incentive of American industry to maintain capacity adequate to potential defense requirements.,35
1980,5618,16,1604,16,1604,Republicans pledge to make the combat readiness of U.S. Armed Forces and the preparedness of the industrial base to a top priority.,22
1980,5619,16,1698,16,1698,Research and Development (R & D) provides a critical means by which our nation can cope with threats to our security.,21
1980,5620,16,1698,16,1698,"In the past, the United States' qualitative and technological superiority provided a foundation for our military superiority.",17
1980,5621,16,1698,16,1698,Yet we are now on the verge of losing this advantage to the Soviet Union because of Mr. Carter's opposition to real increases in the R & D effort.,29
1980,5622,16,1698,16,1698,Delays imposed on the R & D process now allow seven to 10 years or more to elapse between the time when a new weapon system is proposed and when it becomes available.,33
1980,5623,16,1698,16,1698,The Soviet Union now invests nearly twice as much in military research and development as does the United States.,19
1980,5624,16,1698,16,1698,This disparity in effort threatens American technological superiority in the mid-1980s and could result in Soviet breakthroughs in advanced weapon systems.,21
1980,5625,16,1698,16,1698,"Republicans pledge to revitalize America's military research and development efforts, from basic research through the deployment of weapons and support systems, to assure that our vital security needs will be met for the balance of the century.",37
1980,5626,16,1698,16,1698,"We will seek increased funding to guarantee American superiority in this critical area and to enable us to deal with possible breakthroughs in anti-missile defense, anti-satellite killers, directed energy systems, and the military and civilian exploitation of space.",38
1980,5627,17,1798,17,1798,America's technological advantage has always depended upon its interaction with our civilian science and technology sector.,16
1980,5628,17,1798,17,1798,"The economic policy of the Carter Administration has severely encumbered private research and development efforts, thereby depriving both our civil and military sectors of the fruits of scientific innovation.",29
1980,5629,17,1798,17,1798,Underfunding of beneficial government-sponsored research efforts in basic and applied scientific research has disrupted the benefits of years of effective effort.,21
1980,5630,17,1701,17,1701,"In particular, America's preeminence in the exploration of space is threatened by the failure of the Carter Administration to fund fully the Space Shuttle program (with its acknowledged benefits for both the civil and military applications) as well as advanced exploration programs.",42
1980,5631,17,1701,17,1701,Republicans pledge to support a vigorous space research program.,9
1980,5632,16,1600,16,1600,The Republican Party pledges to reform the defense programming and budgeting management system established by the Carter Administration.,18
1980,5633,16,1600,16,1600,"The ill-informed, capricious intrusions of the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation have brought defense planning full circle to the worst faults of the McNamara years.",36
1980,5634,16,1600,16,1600,Orderly planning by the military services has become impossible.,9
1980,5635,16,1600,16,1600,"Waste, inefficiency, and paralysis have been the hallmarks of Carter Administration defense planning and budgeting.",15
1980,5636,16,1600,16,1600,This has resulted in huge cost overruns and in protracted delays in placing advanced systems in the field.,18
1980,5637,16,1603,16,1603,"At a time of increasing danger, the U.S. intelligence community has lost much of its ability to supply the President, senior U.S. officials, and the Congress with accurate and timely analyses concerning fundamental threats to our nation's security.",38
1980,5638,16,1603,16,1603,Morale and public confidence have been eroded and American citizens and friendly foreign intelligence services have become increasingly reluctant to cooperate with U.S. agencies.,24
1980,5639,16,1603,16,1603,"As a result of such problems, the U.S. Intelligence community has incorrectly assessed critical foreign developments, as in Iran, and has, above all, underestimated the size and purpose of the Soviet Union's military efforts.",34
1980,5640,16,1603,16,1603,We believe that a strong national consensus has emerged on the need to make our intelligence community a reliable and productive instrument of national policy once again.,27
1980,5641,16,1603,16,1603,"In pursuing its objectives, the Soviet Union and its surrogates operate by a far different set of rules than does the United States.",23
1980,5642,16,1603,16,1603,We do not favor countering their efforts by mirroring their tactics.,11
1980,5643,16,1603,16,1603,"However, the United States requires a realistic assessment of the threats it faces, and it must have the best intelligence capability in the world.",24
1980,5644,16,1603,16,1603,Republicans pledge this for the United States.,7
1980,5645,16,1603,16,1603,"A Republican Administration will seek to improve U.S. Intelligence capabilities for technical and clandestine collection, cogent analysis, coordinated counterintelligence, and covert action.",22
1980,5646,16,1603,16,1603,"We will reestablish the President's Foreign intelligence Advisory Board, abolished by the Carter Administration, as a permanent nonpartisan body of distinguished Americans to perform a constant audit of national intelligence research and performance.",33
1980,5647,16,1603,16,1603,We will propose methods of providing alternative intelligence estimates in order to improve the quality of the estimates by constructive competition.,21

1980,5650,16,1603,16,1603,We will support legislation to invoke criminal sanctions against anyone who discloses the identities of U.S. intelligence officers abroad or who makes unauthorized disclosures of U.S. intelligence sources and methods.,30
1980,5651,16,1603,16,1603,We will support amendments to the Freedom of information Act and the Privacy Act to permit meaningful background checks on individuals being considered for sensitive positions and to reduce costly and capricious requests to the intelligence agencies.,37

1980,5653,16,1603,16,1603,"A Republican Administration will seek adequate safeguards to ensure that past abuses will not recur, but we will seek the repeal of ill-considered restrictions sponsored by Democrats, which have debilitated U.S. intelligence capabilities while easing the intelligence collection and subversion efforts of our adversaries.",44
1980,5654,19,1927,19,1927,"In the decade of the seventies, all civilized nations were shaken by a wave of widespread, international terrorist attacks.",19
1980,5655,19,1927,19,1927,"Time and again, nations and individuals have been subjected to extortion and murder at the hands of extremists who reject the rule of law, civil order, and the sanctity of individual human rights.",33
1980,5656,19,1927,19,1927,"Terrorism has been elevated to the level of overt national policy as authorities in Iran, encouraged by the Soviet Union, have held 53 Americans captive for more than eight months.",30
1980,5657,19,1927,19,1927,"Comprehensive support of international terrorist organizations has been a central, though generally covert, element of Soviet foreign policy.",18

1980,5659,19,1927,19,1927,"We believe that certain principles have emerged from incidents in which states have defeated terrorist attacks, and we believe the United States should take the lead in a multilateral drive to eliminate the terrorist threat.",35
1980,5660,19,1927,19,1927,A first requirement is the establishment of a military capability to deal promptly and effectively with any terrorist acts.,19
1980,5661,19,1927,19,1927,"We cannot afford, as in the abortive Iranian rescue mission, to allow months to pass while we prepare responses.",19
1980,5662,19,1927,19,1927,The United States must provide the leadership to forge an international consensus that firmness and refusal to concede are ultimately the only effective deterrents to terrorism.,26
1980,5663,19,1927,19,1927,The United States should take the lead in combating international terrorism.,11
1980,5664,19,1927,19,1927,We must recognize and be prepared to deal with the reality of expanded Soviet sponsorship of international terrorist movements.,19
1980,5665,19,1927,19,1927,Development of an effective antiterrorist military capability and establishment of a Congressional and Executive capability to oversee our internal security efforts will no longer be neglected.,26
1980,5666,16,1605,16,1605,The Republican approach to arms control has been markedly different from that of the Democratic Party.,16
1980,5667,16,1605,16,1605,It has been based on three fundamental premises:,8
1980,5668,16,1605,16,1605,"First, before arms control negotiations may be undertaken, the security of the United States must be assured by the funding and deployment of strong military forces sufficient to deter conflict at any level or to prevail in battle should aggression occur;",41
1980,5669,16,1605,16,1605,"Second, negotiations must be conducted on the basis of strict reciprocity of benefits√≠√Øunilateral restraint by the U.S. has failed to bring reductions by the Soviet Union; and",27
1980,5670,16,1605,16,1605,"Third, arms control negotiations, once entered, represent an important political and military undertaking that cannot be divorced from the broader political and military behavior of the parties.",27
1980,5671,16,1605,16,1605,A Republican Administration will pursue arms control solely on the principles outlined above.,13
1980,5672,16,1605,16,1605,"During the past three and one-half years, the Carter Administration's policy has been [p.36] diametrically opposed to these principles.",19
1980,5673,16,1605,16,1605,"First, by its willful cancellation or delay of essential strategic military programs such as the B-1, the MX missile, and the Trident submarine, it has seriously damaged the credibility and effectiveness of the U.S. deterrent force.",36
1980,5674,16,1605,16,1605,"Second, by not insisting upon corresponding concessions from the Soviet Union it has, in effect, practiced unilateral disarmament and removed any incentives for the Soviets to negotiate for what they could obviously achieve by waiting.",35
1980,5675,16,1605,16,1605,The Republican Party rejects the fundamentally flawed SALT II treaty negotiated by the Carter Administration.,15
1980,5676,16,1605,16,1605,The Republican Party deplores the attempts of the Carter Administration to cover up Soviet non-compliance with arms control agreements including the now overwhelming evidence of blatant Soviet violation of the Biological Warfare Convention by secret production of biological agents at Sverdlovsk.,41
1980,5677,8,801,8,801,"In our platform four years ago, we stated that, ""The growth of civilian nuclear technology and the rising demand for nuclear power as an alternative to increasingly costly fossil fuel resources, combine to require our recognition of the potential dangers associated with such development.""",44
1980,5678,16,1605,16,1605,We called for the formation of new multilateral arrangements to control the export of sensitive nuclear technologies.,17

1980,5680,16,1605,16,1605,In particular we oppose and deplore the pending delivery to India of nuclear material which can be directed to the manufacture of weapons.,23
1980,5681,16,1605,16,1605,The Republican Party reaffirms its commitment to the early establishment of effective multilateral arrangements for the safe management and monitoring of all transfers and uses of nuclear materials in the international market.,32
1980,5682,19,1921,19,1921,"The premier challenge facing the United States, its allies, and the entire globe is to check the Soviet Union's global ambitions.",21
1980,5683,19,1921,19,1921,"This challenge must be met, for the present danger is greater than ever before in the 200-year history of the United States.",22
1980,5684,19,1921,19,1921,The Soviet Union is still accelerating its drive for military superiority and is intensifying its military pressure and its ideological combat against the industrial democracies and the vulnerable developing nations of the world.,33
1980,5685,19,1921,19,1921,Republicans believe that the United States can only negotiate with the Soviet Union from a position of unquestioned principle and unquestioned strength.,22
1980,5686,19,1921,19,1921,"Unlike Mr. Carter, we see nothing ""inordinate"" in our nation's historic judgment about the goals, tactics, and dangers of Soviet communism.",21
1980,5687,19,1921,19,1921,"Unlike the Carter Administration, we are not surprised by the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or by other Soviet violations of major international agreements regulating international behavior, human rights, and the use of military force.",35
1980,5688,19,1921,19,1921,"And, unlike the Carter Administration, we will not base our policies toward the Soviet Union on naive expectations, unilateral concessions, futile rhetoric, and insignificant maneuvers.",25
1980,5689,19,1921,19,1921,"As the Soviet Union continues in its expansionist course, the potential for dangerous confrontations has increased.",16
1980,5690,19,1921,19,1921,"Republicans will strive to resolve critical issues through peaceful negotiations, but we recognize that negotiations conducted from a position of military weakness can result only in further damage to American interests.",31
1980,5691,16,1605,16,1605,"A Republican Administration will continue to seek to negotiate arms reductions in Soviet strategic weapons, in Soviet bloc force levels in Central Europe, and in other areas that may be amenable to reductions or limitations.",35
1980,5692,16,1605,16,1605,"We will pursue hard bargaining for equitable, verifiable, and enforceable agreements.",11
1980,5693,16,1605,16,1605,"We will accept no agreement for the sake of having an agreement, and will accept no agreements that do not fundamentally enhance our national security.",25
1980,5694,17,1705,17,1705,"Republicans oppose the transfer of high technology to the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, such as has been done in the past, permitting development of sophisticated military hardware which threatens the United States and our allies.",38
1980,5695,17,1705,17,1705,The Carter Administration has encouraged the most extensive raid on American technology by the Soviet bloc since World War II.,20
1980,5696,17,1705,17,1705,"The Soviet Union has gained invaluable scientific expertise in electronics, computer sciences, manufacturing techniques, mining, transportation, aviation, agriculture, and a host of other disciplines.",24
1980,5697,17,1705,17,1705,This has contributed to the ability of the Soviet Union to divert investment and manpower from their civilian economy to their armed forces.,23
1980,5698,17,1705,17,1705,The fruits of Soviet access to American technology will improve the performance of the Soviet military establishment for years to come.,21
1980,5699,17,1705,17,1705,The matter is compounded by the practice of subsidized financing of much of the Soviet bloc's acquisition of American technology through U.S. financial institutions.,24
1980,5700,17,1705,17,1705,"Republicans pledge to stop the flow of technology to the Soviet Union that could contribute, directly or indirectly, to the growth of their military power.",25
1980,5701,17,1705,17,1705,This objective will be pursued by a Republican Administration with our allies and other friendly nations as well.,18
1980,5702,19,1921,19,1921,We will ensure that the Soviet Union fully understands that it will be expected to fulfill all of the commercial and diplomatic obligations it has undertaken in its international agreements.,30
1980,5703,4,401,4,401,We oppose Mr. Carter's singling out the American farmer to bear the brunt of his failed foreign policy by imposition of a partial and incompetently managed grain embargo.,28
1980,5704,4,401,4,401,"Because of his failure to obtain cooperation from other grain exporting countries, the [p.37] embargo has been a travesty and a substitute for policy.",24
1980,5705,4,401,4,401,We call for the immediate lifting of this embargo.,9
1980,5706,19,1925,19,1925,We reaffirm our commitment to press the Soviet Union to implement the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the Helsinki Agreements which guarantee rights such as the free interchange of information and the right to emigrate.,37
1980,5707,19,1925,19,1925,"A Republican Administration will press the Soviet Union to end its harassment and imprisonment of those who speak in opposition to official policy, who seek to worship according to their religious beliefs, or who represent diverse ethnic minorities and nationalities.",40
1980,5708,19,1925,19,1925,"Republicans deplore growing anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and the mistreatment of ""refuseniks"" by Soviet authorities.",16
1980,5709,19,1925,19,1925,The decline in exit visas to Soviet Jews and others seeking religious freedom and the promulgation of ever more rigorous conditions inhibiting their emigration are a fundamental affront to human rights and the U.N. Charter.,35
1980,5710,19,1925,19,1925,Republicans will make the subject of emigration from the Soviet Union a central issue in Soviet-American relations.,17
1980,5711,19,1925,19,1925,Human rights in the Soviet Union will not be ignored as it has been during the Carter Administration.,18

1980,5714,19,1921,19,1921,We stand firmly for the independence of Yugoslavia.,8
1980,5715,19,1921,19,1921,We support self-determination and genuine independence for new captive nations of Africa and Latin America threatened by the growing domination of Soviet power.,23
1980,5716,19,1921,19,1921,A Republican Administration will end the sustained Carter policy of misleading the American people about Soviet policies and behavior.,19
1980,5717,19,1921,19,1921,"We will spare no efforts to publicize to the world the fundamental differences in the two systems and will strengthen such means as the international Communications Agency, the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty actively to articulate U.S. values and policies, and to highlight the weaknesses of totalitarianism.",51
1980,5718,19,1921,19,1921,"We pledge to end the Carter cover-up of Soviet violations of SALT I and II, to end the cover-up of Soviet violation of the Biological Warfare Convention, and to end the cover-up of Soviet use of gas and chemical weapons in Afghanistan and elsewhere.",44
